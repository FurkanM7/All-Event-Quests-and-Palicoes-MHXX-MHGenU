# All Event Quests and Palicoes MH XX and MH GenU Save files

## Introduction

This repository contains save files for *Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate* (Nintendo Switch) and *Monster Hunter XX* (Nintendo Switch & Nintendo 3DS). The saves include all event quests and all event Palicoes officially distributed over the years.

All event Palicoes were provided by **Levobertus** on Reddit, who has spent years helping hunters obtain event Palicoes by manually trading them with anyone in need, including myself. He also created a detailed spreadsheet containing information about which Palicoes have which abilities:

Although all event quests for *Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate* are still downloadable from the Internet on the console, this save file serves as a preservation effort. On the other hand, the *Monster Hunter XX* save file contains event quests that are no longer available for download.

## Save File Contents

- **Event Quests**: Available for all characters and accessible even with a newly created character in an open slot.
- **Event Palicoes**: Included in the save file but must be manually transferred to your characters.

## How to Use Event Quests

Event quests will be automatically available in the game. If you want to use your own character, you can create a new one in an available slot and still have access to all event quests. You can also overwrite existing character slots, and the event quests will still be available in the game.

## How to Obtain Event Palicoes

Palicoes are not automatically transferred to new characters. You can obtain them in two ways:

1. **Online/Local Method**: Join an online or local lobby with the character "Palico" from the save file. From there, you can manually transfer the Palicoes to your character. You will need another person with the save file to trade the Palicoes or a second console to perform the transfer yourself.
2. **Alternative Method (Save Editor)**: If preferred, you can use a save editor to directly import the Palicoes into your existing save file. The Palicoes are saved individually in `.catzx` format, compatible with the following editor:

## Important Notes

- Make sure to back up your save files before overwriting them with these.
- Manual Palico transfers require a connection with another player who has the "Palico" character in their save file or a second console to facilitate the transfer.
- Use save editors with caution to avoid file corruption.
- This guide does not explain how to transfer save files to or from your console. There are guides available online that cover the process in detail.
